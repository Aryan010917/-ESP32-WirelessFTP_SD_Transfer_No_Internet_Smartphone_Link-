# -ESP32-WirelessFTP_SD_Transfer_No_Internet_Smartphone_Link-
This project is a wireless FTP server on ESP32 enabling two-way SD card file transfers with smartphones over Wi-Fi, without internet. Using the AndFTP app as client, it functions like an external drive. Tests show typical transfer speeds around 5 Mbps, slower with large files like photos.
